    <string name="about">About Rick and Morty</string>
    <string name="aboutRMText">The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth,
        their children Summer and Morty, and Beth s father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives
        outside of Seattle, Washington. The adventures of Rick and Morty, however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the characters
        travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick s flying car.
        Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently
        goes on adventures with his 14 year old grandson, Morty, a kind hearted but easily distressed boy, whose naive but grounded moral compass plays
        counterpoint to Rick s Machiavellian ego. Morty s 17 year old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status
        among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids mother, Beth, is a generally level headed person and assertive
        force in the household, though self conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry,
        a simple minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick s influence over his family.</string>
